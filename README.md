# Final Project Instructions
I believe that jupyterLab will already have python3 and pip installed, but here it is just in case.

1. Have python3 installed
to check, run `python3 --version`. if not, run `sudo apt install python3`

2. Have pip installed
Just run `python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade`, it will install it if it isnt already

3. Install pipenv
first, try running `pip install pipenv`
if you get `error: externally-managed-environment`,
try `sudo apt install pipenv`

4. Install flask
first, youll need to go into the virtual environment by `pipenv shell`
