# Final Project Instructions
I believe that jupyterLab will already have python3 and pip installed, but here it is just in case.

1. Have python3 installed
--1. to check, run `python3 --version`. if not, run `sudo apt install python3`

2. Have pip installed
--2. Just run `python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade`, it will install it if it isnt already

3. Install pipenv
--3. run `pip install pipenv`

4. Install flask
--4. first, youll need to go into the virtual environment
